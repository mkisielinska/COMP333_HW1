  <p>This service allowed me to expand my music taste and find friends across the country. It over-delivers.
    Community, concerts, comradery, compassion - cannot get enough of MEOWSIC! ~CoolCat1 </p>

  <p> I have always wanted to make more room for music in my life and to engage with the content I
  consume daily - MEOWSIC has allowed me to become more conscientious of what and when I listen to.
  Music is experienced in an entirely new way! ~CoolCat2 </p>

  <p> Perhaps, MEOWSIC overpromises, but it delivers just the right amount of service! It's improved
  my streaming experience a lot! ~CoolCat3 </p>
